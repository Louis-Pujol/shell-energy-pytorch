# shell-energy-pytorch
PyTorch Implementation of [shell energy](https://gitlab.com/numod/shell-energy)

TODO:

- [ ] Add an action to setup a python environment with pyshell
- [ ] Write pytorch code for shell energy
- [ ] Test: do we obtain the same values on examples ?
- [ ] Test: do we obtain the same gradients with `torch.autograd` ?
- [ ] Benchmark : which one is faster ? Is GPU provides an acceleration ?
